# Terminology

Under the hood ORBAT Mapper uses a data model loosely inspired by
the [Military Scenario Definition Language (MSDL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_Scenario_Definition_Language).
In this section we will go through some terminology you will encounter while building a scenario.

## Sides and groups

A scenario consists of _units_ organized into _sides_ and _groups_. A side typically represents a nation or
coalition. In a WWII scenario the sides would typically be _Allied forces_ and _Axis forces_.

For each side you can specify a standard identity / affiliation. The standard identity determines the color and shape
of the unit icons. The most commonly used ones are friend, neutral and hostile:

<div class="grid grid-cols-3 gap-0 items-center justify-items-center content-end">
    <DocMilSymbol sidc="10031000000000000000" />
    <DocMilSymbol sidc="10041000000000000000" />
    <DocMilSymbol sidc="10061000000000000000" />
    <p>Friend</p>
    <p>Neutral</p>
    <p>Hostile</p>
</div>

You can also select custom colors. This is useful in cases when you do not want to label a side as hostile or want to
distinguish different nations by symbol color.

<div class="grid grid-cols-3 gap-0 items-center justify-items-center content-end">
    <DocMilSymbol sidc="10031000000000000000" :modifiers="{fillColor: '#aab074'}"/>
    <DocMilSymbol sidc="10031000000000000000" :modifiers="{fillColor: '#ffd00b'}"/>
    <DocMilSymbol sidc="10031000000000000000" :modifiers="{fillColor: '#ff3333'}"/>
</div>

Each side consists of one or more groups of units. A group is just a way to organize your units. They can for instance
represent branches (army, navy, air-force, etc.), a task force, a battlefront, etc. You can also choose not to use groups
and place units directly under a side.

A side/group consists of one or more unit hierarchies. The topmost unit in a hierarchy is called a _root unit_.

## Units

A unit is the basic building block of a scenario. It represents a military unit, such as a platoon, company,
battalion,but it can also be used to represent infrastructure, equipment, vehicles, etc.

<div class="grid grid-cols-3 gap-0 items-center justify-items-center content-end">
    <DocMilSymbol sidc="10031000161211000000" />
    <DocMilSymbol sidc="10031000141205000000" />
    <DocMilSymbol sidc="10061000151301020000" />
</div>

Units are organized hierarchically in a tree structure:

Each unit has a set of attributes. The most commonly used
attributes include:

- _name_
- _symbol/icon_
- _location_

Additional attributes can be assigned to units. Examples of these are:

- _description_
- _image_
- _url_
- _symbol modifiers_
- _average speed_
- _maximum speed_

### Unit state

In ORBAT Mapper, the state of a unit refers to the current values of its attributes, which can change over time. For
instance, a unit's location updates as it moves, and its symbol may change if it sustains damage or is destroyed. While
ORBAT Mapper is not a simulation tool, it can track changes in some unit attributes as the scenario unfolds.

### Table of Organization and Equipment (TO&E)

A military unit is composed of personnel and equipment. This composition is often referred to as [Table of Organization
and Equipment (TO&E)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_of_organization_and_equipment). The TO&E outlines the
structure, roles, and responsibilities of personnel within the unit and specifies the types and quantities of its
equipment.

ORBAT mapper has basic support for representing TO&E-data.

## Map layers and features

The map is an important part of a scenario. A scenario map consists of multiple layers. The _base layer_ is drawn first
an on top of that you can add raster _map layers_ and then _feature layers_.

A raster map layer consists of one or more raster images. Typical raster map sources are aerial photos and scanned maps.
Feature layers consists of one or more _features_. A feature is a styled point, line or polygon on the map.
